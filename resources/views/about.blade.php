                    <p>Dr Michelle Ronksley-Pavia is a world-leading researcher in the field gifted and talented and twice

                        digital technologies. Our research lab has been awarded several grants to explore the role of online
                        digital technologies to support gifted and talented children at school and home. These research projects
                        have revealed the vital role that teachers play in providing positive and productive online experiences for
                        school children, however expert leadership, resources and training are essential for successful online learning
                        and experiences that will re(engage) gifted students. Selected research publications from our research lab and
                        related projects can be seen below.</p>


                    <h4>Parent Assessments for Gifted and Talented Students</h4>
                    <p>This parent assessment of young children’s (2 to 6 years old) will
                        provide an overarching picture of children’s physical, cognitive and
                        social-emotional gifts and strengths. It will give some key indicators
                        of whether your child displays characteristics of giftedness such as
                        memory, creativity, humour, vocabulary and imagination. This short
                        observational assessment will enable parents to further understand
                        their child’s areas of interest and empower them to help their child
                        to excel in the future. </p>

                    <h4>Teachers Assessments for Gifted and Talented Students</h4>
                    <p>This teacher assessment for primary school children (6 to 12 years old)
                        is a checklist that can be used to help teachers identify their student’s
                        potential areas of giftedness (Intellectual, Creative, Social, Perceptual,
                        Physical domains) and indicators that may assist in further specific identification
                        measures are needed (e.g., Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children – WISC-V).</p>
